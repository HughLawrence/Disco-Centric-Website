<h1>Disco Centric Website</h1>

 <p>The project task was to redesign and implement a website for a Cardiff-based wedding and function band, Disco Centric. All logos, colour schemes and styling were designed from scratch as part of a complete rebranding from the band's original Wix website. In total, eight pages were created.</p>
<br>
<p>In this project, SASS was used extensively to compile the CSS. This choice was to enable both cleaner code and greater cohesion in the colour schemes, transition effects and other stylings.
</p>
 <br>
<p> The site also includes a hero section with a video of the band performing, an Instagram gallery and a Soundcloud player with various recordings of the band.</p>
